I'm Alec Hollingsworth.  I like writing software, playing guitar, reading documentation, and listening to Jimi Hendrix.  I grew up in Northern Virginia, graduated college in upstate New York, then went to work for the Air Force.  I joined Code Fellows here in Portland, OR and have been studying and learning JavaScript every day since.
